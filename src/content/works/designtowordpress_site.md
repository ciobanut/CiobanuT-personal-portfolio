    title: 'Building the Core Pages'
    desc: 'We begin by converting the most important screens — usually the homepage and landing pages. This is where we ensure pixel-perfect accuracy: fonts, spacing, grids, and animations follow the design exactly. The homepage becomes the blueprint for the rest of the site.'

    desc: 'With the style system and homepage in place, we move on to the inner pages. Services, About, Contact, Blog, or any other custom layouts are built in line with the established design system. Thanks to Bricks Builder + Automatic.css, this stage is much faster and more consistent.'
