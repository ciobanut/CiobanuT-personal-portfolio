I was contacted to create the company's website. The logo and content were ready-made and were provided by Supreme Veritas. The design was chosen a wordpress template, I chose not to buy it but to recreate it in Elementor and adapted it to the style of the brand.

### Plugins I used to create this website:

- **Elementor pro** - for creating the entire website
- **Ele Custom Skin** - to create custom design for Pods custom post types archives. At the time of wesite creation, Elementor Pro did not have this functionality as it does now.
- **Pods** - for creating custom post types.
- **Yoast SEO** - All-in-one SEO solution for WordPress.
- **Easy Hide Login** - Hide `/wp-login` route and increase site security.
