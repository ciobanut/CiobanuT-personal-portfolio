    title: 'We started with planning'
    desc: 'At first, the client only knew they wanted a website to present and promote their travel services, without online bookings. We sat down, discussed the company’s goals, and mapped out the structure of the site—pages like Home, About Us, Services, Tours, and Contact. At that point, everything was still abstract, but putting it on paper gave us clarity.'

    title: 'Designing the look and feel'
    desc: 'Once we had the structure, I moved on to the design. I created layouts for the homepage and key pages, focusing on a clean, modern style that would look great on mobile. I included space for statistics, customer reviews, and strong visuals of tours. After a few iterations, we had a design that reflected both the company’s history and its adventurous spirit.'

    title: 'Setting up WordPress'
    desc: 'Next came the technical foundation. I installed WordPress on a test server, chose the Hello Elementor theme, and set up the builder and plugins. Security, SEO, caching, and backup solutions were all configured so the site would run smoothly. This was the skeleton that everything else would be built on.'

    title: 'Bringing the site to life'
    desc: 'With the setup done, I started building the actual pages. The homepage became a showcase of the company’s credibility—50 years of experience, multilingual staff, thousands of successful trips. The Services and Tours sections highlighted everything from visa assistance to safaris and balloon rides. I added a WhatsApp button for quick contact, since all bookings are finalized offline. Slowly, the project turned from a wireframe into a living website.'

    title: 'Testing every detail'
    desc: 'When all the content was in place, I tested the site on desktop, tablet, and mobile. I checked the speed, optimized the images, and made sure that all the pages rendered correctly on different devices. Some small bugs popped up, but after fixes and adjustments, the site became fast and reliable.'

    desc: 'Finally, it was time to go live. I migrated the site to the official domain, set up SSL for secure browsing, and connected analytics. At this stage, I also trained the client’s team on how to add new content, update services, and keep testimonials fresh without needing a developer.'

    title: 'Ongoing maintenance'
    desc: 'Even after launch, the story doesn’t end. The site needs updates—WordPress core, plugins, backups, and security checks. We agreed on a simple maintenance plan to keep everything up-to-date and safe, so the company can focus on what matters: giving travelers unforgettable experiences.'
