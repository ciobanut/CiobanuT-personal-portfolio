      <p>Hi, I'm Tudor — a web developer with a strong focus on <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong>, and clean, maintainable code. I build modern websites and web applications that are fast, secure, and user-friendly.</p>
      <p>I started as a self-taught developer, driven by curiosity and the need to solve real problems. Over time, I’ve worked with clients from various industries, helping them bring their digital ideas to life — whether it’s a company presentation site, a custom dashboard, or an e-commerce platform.</p>
      <p>Along the way, I discovered a love for backend logic, structured APIs, and scalable architecture — and Laravel quickly became my favorite tool. But I also appreciate the practicality and flexibility of WordPress when used right.</p>
      <p>My workflow often includes tools like <strong>Livewire</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Alpine.js</strong>, and <strong>Docker</strong>, and I enjoy exploring new technologies like <strong>Astro.js</strong> to expand my skillset.</p>
      <p>What sets me apart is not just the code I write, but how I approach each project: with <strong>attention to detail</strong>, a <strong>sense of responsibility</strong>, and a constant drive to improve — both the product and myself.</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m on a journey to level up from intermediate to senior, and this portfolio is part of that path.</p>
